            <h2 class="navigation-item" >About Work-Life Balance for Mothers</h2>

            <p>
                The pressure of an increasingly demanding work culture is one of the biggest challenges to society... A healthy work-life balance will mean different things to us all. It’s not so much about splitting your time 50/50 between work and leisure but making sure you feel fulfilled and content in both areas of your life. (Mental Health Foundation, 2021).

                It can be easy to normalise working long hours or being under an extreme amount of stress, especially if we’ve been doing it for a long time or all our colleagues are in the same boat. Our assumptions and habits around work can become deep-rooted unless we take a step back once in a while.

                It’s not always possible to make changes at work: if you’re on a zero hours contract you might not feel comfortable speaking up, for instance, or you might need to work long hours to earn enough money to pay your bills.

                Let alone, have children to take care of! Along with joy and certain life fullfillment being a parent is a 24/7 work on its own. Many working mothers struggle juggling with home-work responsibilities at the same time having constant shortage of time and feeling increasing fatigue day by day. Mother's guilt is another issue that is weighing upon the shoulders, especially if the working hours are long.

                So, let's get to the 10 most practical lifehacks that have been tested by moms and proven efficient for happily managing family, careers while enjoying the life.

            <h3>1. Time Management <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> </h3>
            <p>A big issue for busy moms – time. We can’t make there be more of it and it slips away so quickly. So how can we make the most of what we have?

                Yolanda from Put the Kettle On is a master of time management, and she does it all using time blocking. This working mom hack works like this. If you need to get something done, set yourself a timer and get that thing done.
                
                Putting off folding the laundry because laundry is terrible? Set a 15-minute timer on your phone and try to beat the clock. Need to make progress on a work project? Set a 45-minute timer and only work on that one thing for that time. No email, no Instagram.
                
                Focused time is significantly more productive than “multitasking getting distracted by all the things” time. If you’re looking at a gazillion and one things to do, tackling your list by chunking out time for each activity can make it more fun and more efficient.</p>
            <p>Of course, advice for how to most efficiently arrange your day isn’t one-size-fits-all, and it takes a lot of reflection and tweaking to get your day optimally scheduled. For example, while most people advise working out in the morning, I found that when I tried, I despised it, and it threw the rest of my day out of whack. Upon discovering this, I switched to afternoon workouts because they work best for me.

                I took a look at other parts of my day to see how I could optimize my schedule for when I am most productive. I now tackle my most consuming and difficult tasks first thing in the morning, and schedule meetings or other group activities for the afternoon. I also take a middle-of-the-day break for an errand so I can come back to my desk feeling refreshed for the rest of the day.
                
                Take a look at your day and see how you can tweak your schedule to best fit you, regardless of what the prevailing advice is for how to be most efficient. Is there a task that drains you that you might be more energized for at a different time of the day? It might be worth re-arranging.</p>
            <p>Instead of dedicating a huge chunk of your weekend to cleaning the house for the upcoming week, divide all the tasks that need to be done and schedule one per day. Do the vacuuming on Sunday, dust surfaces on Monday, collect garbage and recycling on Tuesday, clean the kitchen Wednesday, and clean the bathroom Thursday.

                This way, the house is always moderately clean. If your children are old enough, get them involved in simple chores, like putting their laundry in the basket, wiping their table area after meals, and putting away toys at the end of the day. After all, it’s the whole family’s house, not just yours!</p>

            <h3>2. Power Nap <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i></h3>
            <p class="wrap-around-image">
                Congratulations – if you’re all into the power nap, you’re in illustrious company. Einstein, Winston Churchill, JFK, and even Leonardo da Vinci were all fans of the afternoon brain shut down. Whether this indicates some kind of connection to greatness is pushing it – but what isn’t in doubt are the benefits of taking 40 winks and enjoying a mental timeout from the rigors of the day.

There was a time when napping during the day found you labeled as a slob. A lazy degenerate with a bad attitude. Well, the sleepyheads out there will be pleased to hear that this is no longer the case – quite the opposite actually.

These days, you don’t need to steal a few minutes of shuteye at a café or on a train. Employers are increasingly recognizing the benefits of a power nap as an effective means of stimulating both attention and performance and are taking this into consideration when planning office layouts and schedules.

However, approaching the issue can raise some questions. When is the best time for a nap? What happens if I nap too long? Where should I try to take my power nap? Well, wonder no more – here’s our 5-point guide to getting the perfect power nap and enjoying a more productive day.

Rule 1 – Power napping is not for everyone
Sorry, but a power nap doesn’t work for all of us. If you suffer from insomnia or have trouble sleeping at night, power napping is probably a bad idea. It can confuse your body clock, disrupt an already dysfunctional routine and you could be staring at the ceiling until the wee small hours. Make sure your power napping routine isn’t affecting your nightly sleep negatively, by tracking your sleep patterns with Sleep Cycle.

Rule 2 – Duration is king
The key to successful power napping is its length. Too much takes you into deep sleep mode, leaving you tired and groggy afterward. Too little is……….well it’s just not enough. Experts tell us that maximum recharging during a power nap is achieved by going from stage 1 sleep (that lovely ‘drifting off’ feeling) to stage 2 (slowdown of brain activity). Going any further is not advised. So how long does this process take? In most people, a power nap length of 15 to 20 minutes is just perfect.

Rule 3 – Timing is everything
The timing of your power nap is crucial – so it’s only right we consult with the people who do it best. The siesta is a long-established cultural pillar in many Mediterranean countries so it would be logical to assume that the sweet spot for power napping is ‘siesta time’. In other words, sometime after lunch and before 3 pm. After the post-lunch energy crash, many people lose focus. Don’t leave it too late though – napping after 3 pm could have an adverse effect on your night’s sleep.

Rule 4 – Find your ‘nappy’ place
First, please excuse the terrible pun in the headline. We couldn’t resist it – but in our defense, choosing your napping zone is a serious business. A place where there’s less risk of being disturbed is a good start. If you can lie down, all the better, although a comfortable chair or even a reclining work chair can do the job too. And why not use those expensive noise-reducing headphones for something other than music? They’ll keep out intrusive noise as well as acting as a ‘stay away’ warning to your co-workers!

Rule 5 – The dozing is in details
So you’ve established you’re a power napper and decided the duration, place, and timing – so what now? Well before you doze off, eliminate as many distractions as possible. Close your laptop or mobile. Shut off your computer screen. If you have a landline telephone (yes, they still exist), divert or hold incoming calls. If you’re lucky enough to have an assistant, tell them you’re in ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode. Whatever it takes!

Happy napping!

As promised, here’s your surprise
Drinking coffee just before a power nap sounds like a crazy idea. However, there are physiological reasons that make it perfect sense. Caffeine doesn’t kick in straight away. It takes between 20 and 45 minutes to start to do its job. So if you drink a cup just before your power nap, you’ll feel more alert when you wake up. Try it – it really works!

            <h3>3. Meal Planning <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i></h3>
            <p>“Prep as much of lunch and breakfast as possible the night before to make things run extra smoothly in the mornings,” says Vekevia Tillman-Jones, who has a preschool age child. Tania, who loves to find ways to save on food that don’t require extreme couponing, makes peanut butter sandwiches in bulk and freezes them. I swear by my slow cooker.

                Planning and prepping meals can save you money (by not resorting as much to take-out) and time. Home cooking has secret financial power!  We all make a little wiggle room for takeout on our busiest days, though, and don’t beat ourselves up if we order a pizza or take-out Thai food.</p>

            <h3>4. Outsourcing tasks <i class="fa-solid fa-list-check"></i></h3>
            <p>Daphne explained that friends hired her teenage daughters to drive their kids to after school activities. “My friends then could work and be around to pick their kids up afterwards,” she noted. “Of course, you must make sure you choose responsible teenagers to haul your precious cargo around, but it was a lifesaver for my friends.”

                I’ve got a retired neighbor who will take kids back and forth to activities. She charges a higher rate than a teenager but she is a more experienced driver! Senior consultant Lisa Painter uses a student au pair to help with kids, which is more affordable than a nanny in pricey Los Angeles. Operations manager Jill McLane relies on her village. “We really depend on our friends and they do the same with us.”</p>
        
            <p>Going to the grocery store by myself can be a vacation, but bring along two kids and it’s an obstacle course. I try to shop with each of my kids individually at least once a month (so they know how to shop and to teach them about financial choices). The rest of the time, I’m looking for hacks.

            “Use a grocery shopping service,” recommended Daphne. Services like Peapod or ShopRite From Home will delivery groceries for a nominal fee. This helps you stick to your budget (no impulse buying!) and saves lots of time. Vekevia likes to order groceries online and set it up for pick-up so all she has to do is drive there and they load her groceries into her car. Jill said, “we use an app, Grocery IQ, that syncs our grocery list so whoever runs out of something adds it and whoever shops has the full list.”</p>

            <h3>5. Set up your Auto Pilots <i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i></h3>
            <p>This is my go-to mom hack to keep on top of the never-ending laundry that comes with having kids. I work from home when I’m not traveling, but you don’t need to work from home to practice this. I put a load in the washer in the morning, switch it to the dryer before dinner, and fold clothes before bed. When I got my first bonus from Financial Finesse, I asked brilliant space maximizer Evelyn Cucchiara (The Toy Tamer) to redo my laundry and play rooms so they were easier to keep tidy (working mom priorities, right?!). Nearly three years later, I am happy to report that both rooms are still tidy.</p>
            <p>Decide on an easy-to-grab, go-to housewarming gift. Choose a universal child’s birthday party gift that you can order online or pick up at a store nearby (or even-number-hack stock up on!). Find an easy-to-make (but still delicious) potluck dish for school events and family gatherings. Pare down your baking repertoire and decide on one thing you’ll make for every bake sale. Have a go-to outfit for important meetings.

                When you are faced with having to bring a gift or a dish or a bottle of wine, you won’t have to spend any extra time shopping around, thinking, or researching what you’ll buy.  </p>
        
            <p>To save time and be more present, I’ve turned off social media notifications on my phone and Lisa from Lisa Tanner Writing finally convinced me to have even more social media willpower.

                Lisa sets specific times of the day where she can look at Facebook. Her time is a precious resource, and she found it was so easy to lose 30 minutes to an hour to scrolling. Keeping social media activity to the evenings helps her stay present during the day and be more productive.
                
                I’m trying to follow Lisa’s lead and do a better job of keeping my phone on the counter when I get back from work. And thanks to technology, I can even set “downtime” on my phone using the Screen Time setting so that I can’t even use it between 5:30 and 8. Even if I’m using Facebook for my work instead of just scrolling, it can still wait until 8:00 pm. Hungry Hungry Hippos, however, cannot.</p>

            <h3>6. Small Tasks Get Things Done <i class="fa-solid fa-drumstick-bite"></i></h3>
            <p>Time-batching is hands-down the best concept I learned in 2018. I first came across the concept when I finally read The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss last year.

                I now use time-batching for a lot of my tasks, like processing email. It takes way less time to reply to 10 emails in a block of time, rather than responding to them here and there when they individually hit my inbox. It also takes much less time to go through everything in my physical mailbox at home once every few days instead of every single evening.
                
                I discovered that time-batching works for a lot of to-dos, but some items still function better as lone tasks. For example, I run a load of laundry usually just once a day. However, I time-batch folding a few loads of laundry at once. Essentially, I’ve discovered that time-consuming and draining tasks work better spread out, and and menial and mundane tasks work well for time-batching.
                
                Take a look at what you have to accomplish each day and see if the spread-out or time-batch method will work for any of them.</p>
            <p>How do I personally “do it all” as a working mom? Simple. I don’t. WE do. Not always perfectly, but as a team.

                If you are a working mom with a partner, this is less of a working mom hack and more of a gentle suggestion. The suggestion being making the care/feeding/cleaning part of your lives a 50/50 split. Moms often carry more of the load of the household but it doesn’t have to be that way.
                
                For a long time, I was almost solely responsible for dinners around our house. But we both worked and were both rushing home at the end of the day. I finally realized that this plan wasn’t sustainable and that Glen could not read my mind.
                
                As soon as I voiced the concern, we came up with a simple plan to each cover specific dinner nights during the week. Tuesday and Thursday are no longer my responsibility and a weight got lifted off my shoulders.
                
                Sometimes working mom life hacks are as simple as using your words.

            <h3>7. Let It Go <i class="fa-solid fa-couch"></i></h3>
            <p>Remember how we talked about “having it all” and figuring out what “having it all” means to you? Part of that is prioritizing what you can Elsa style let go.

                I’m going to be honest with you. My house is passably clean at best. It’s not all together dirty, but it’s not neat. The sink is not always cleared out every night. There is a stack of preschool art on the counter. I’m not sure where the Windex is.
                
                But it’s fine. We’re fine. I’ve let it go. Someday my house might be immaculate, but that day is not today. As a working mom with insanely active children and my own active imagination, there is only so much I can, and want, to do.
                
                This is why “let it go” is one of the best working mom life hacks I can leave you with. This working mom life is not going to look perfect from all angles, but it’s your life. Focus on the angles that matter most to you.
                
                What can you let go a little to give yourself the time for rest and fun? Find it.

            <h3>8. Private Time Just for Yourself <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i></h3>
            <p>Like Yolanda, Taylor from The Accomplished Family knows that you can’t make time appear out of thin air, but she and I absolutely agree that some things are worth carving out time for. Specifically, the Non-Negotiables.

                The Non-Negotiable(s) are the one thing or things that you are going to do for you as a working mom that day/week barring any massive unforeseen circumstances. This doesn’t need to be something monumental, but it should be yours.
                
                Example. Your Non-Negotiable could taking a walk every day at lunch. If you’re in a desk job especially, stretching those legs and getting some fresh air may be exactly what the doctor ordered to clean your head and give your body a little exercise.
                
                Or your Non-Negotiable could be reading for 20 minutes in the morning while the kids are still asleep, giving yourself an hour in the evening once a week for a pottery lesson, or calling the babysitter once a month for a night out with your spouse.
                
                Whatever it is that you know would make your working mom life feel a bit more like YOUR life, put it on your calendar and keep the appointment with yourself.</p>

            <h3>9. Family as Support System <i class="fa-solid fa-people-roof"></i></h3>
            <p>
                As rough and tough as life can get at times, having the best support system around you can make all the difference. For as long as I can remember, my family and I have always been four peas in a pod. Sure, we had our classic spats here and there, but we’ve always had each other’s back through thick and thin. I’ve dragged my family into some of my hardest times—times where I felt alone with no friends, times where my physical and mental health were on a slippery decline, and times where I had no inkling of what I wanted to do in life. But through it all, I’ve had one constant in my life, one grip of hope where I felt myself slipping—my family. I’m lucky enough to say that regardless of any struggles thrown in my direction, my family is my go-to and best support system. Here are some of my reasons why family will always be the best support system.

            <p>Candace from The Mom at Law is one of my people. She has three little ones under the age of five, is a lawyer, a writer, and one of the funniest people I know.

                As one of her work from home working mom tips, she recommends connecting with like-minded folks and I couldn’t agree more. Especially because she called them “folks.”
                
                It’s important it is to have people in your life who understand the challenges you are facing and can offer support, ideas, and a good laugh. At the office, there are people I know I can turn to if I need to have a mini break down about daycare. For my writing, I have groups of social media friends who make me laugh, support my work, and are so hilariously relatable. On the home front, I have working mom friends I can text to say “Ummm… pizza sauce is a vegetable right? Please tell pizza sauce is a vegetable.”
                
                Your people don’t need to live next door, or even in the same state. But when you find the right folks you can relate to and share with, your working mom life is going to feel a lot more fun.</p>
