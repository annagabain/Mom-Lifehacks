            <p>“Prep as much of lunch and breakfast as possible the night before to make things run extra smoothly in the mornings,” says Vekevia Tillman-Jones, who has a preschool age child. Tania, who loves to find ways to save on food that don’t require extreme couponing, makes peanut butter sandwiches in bulk and freezes them. I swear by my slow cooker.

                Planning and prepping meals can save you money (by not resorting as much to take-out) and time. Home cooking has secret financial power!  We all make a little wiggle room for takeout on our busiest days, though, and don’t beat ourselves up if we order a pizza or take-out Thai food.</p>

            <p>Time-batching is hands-down the best concept I learned in 2018. I first came across the concept when I finally read The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss last year.

                I now use time-batching for a lot of my tasks, like processing email. It takes way less time to reply to 10 emails in a block of time, rather than responding to them here and there when they individually hit my inbox. It also takes much less time to go through everything in my physical mailbox at home once every few days instead of every single evening.
                
                I discovered that time-batching works for a lot of to-dos, but some items still function better as lone tasks. For example, I run a load of laundry usually just once a day. However, I time-batch folding a few loads of laundry at once. Essentially, I’ve discovered that time-consuming and draining tasks work better spread out, and and menial and mundane tasks work well for time-batching.
                
                Take a look at what you have to accomplish each day and see if the spread-out or time-batch method will work for any of them.</p>
