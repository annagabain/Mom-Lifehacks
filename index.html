                "The pressure of an increasingly demanding work culture is one of the biggest challenges to society... A healthy work-life balance will mean different things to us all.

                <h3>1. Manage your Time <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> </h3>
                <p>
                    There are only limited amount of hours in each day. Every mom knows that the time flies by and there is so much to do! Be the master of your schedule and asign a to-do list per daytime, weekdays and periodically. It can be beneficial to know your personal productivity timing. Ask yourself, for example, when am I the best at writing emails? Some moms find it easier to focus in the evenings, some in the mornings. So set up the to-do-s accordingly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assigning cleaning tasks for each weekday, for example helps keeping the house moderately tidy and not to be overwhelmed with hours and hours cleaning all at once.
                    The schedule does not need to be extremely precise, otherwise you are risking to cause yourself extra stress. That way you can focus on one thing at a time, have it done and move on to the next. However, do not forget to take small breaks in-between. Not only they will mark the completed tasks, but will drastically improve your performance with the next ones.

                <p>
                Employers are increasingly recognizing the benefits of a power nap as an effective means of stimulating both attention and performance and are taking this into consideration when planning office layouts and schedules.
                However, approaching the issue can raise some questions. When is the best time for a nap? What happens if I nap too long? Where should I try to take my power nap?<br>-sometimes does not work
                <br>-duration is the key

                <h3>3. Plan the Meals <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i></h3>
                <p>“Prep as much of lunch and breakfast as possible the night before to make things run extra smoothly in the mornings,” says Vekevia Tillman-Jones, who has a preschool age child. Tania, who loves to find ways to save on food that don’t require extreme couponing, makes peanut butter sandwiches in bulk and freezes them. I swear by my slow cooker.

                    Planning and prepping meals can save you money (by not resorting as much to take-out) and time. Home cooking has secret financial power!  We all make a little wiggle room for takeout on our busiest days, though, and don’t beat ourselves up if we order a pizza or take-out Thai food.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Outsource some Tasks <i class="fa-solid fa-list-check"></i></h3>
                <p>Daphne explained that friends hired her teenage daughters to drive their kids to after school activities. “My friends then could work and be around to pick their kids up afterwards,” she noted. “Of course, you must make sure you choose responsible teenagers to haul your precious cargo around, but it was a lifesaver for my friends.”

                    I’ve got a retired neighbor who will take kids back and forth to activities. She charges a higher rate than a teenager but she is a more experienced driver! Senior consultant Lisa Painter uses a student au pair to help with kids, which is more affordable than a nanny in pricey Los Angeles. Operations manager Jill McLane relies on her village. “We really depend on our friends and they do the same with us.”</p>
            
                <p>Going to the grocery store by myself can be a vacation, but bring along two kids and it’s an obstacle course. I try to shop with each of my kids individually at least once a month (so they know how to shop and to teach them about financial choices). The rest of the time, I’m looking for hacks.

                “Use a grocery shopping service,” recommended Daphne. Services like Peapod or ShopRite From Home will delivery groceries for a nominal fee. This helps you stick to your budget (no impulse buying!) and saves lots of time. Vekevia likes to order groceries online and set it up for pick-up so all she has to do is drive there and they load her groceries into her car. Jill said, “we use an app, Grocery IQ, that syncs our grocery list so whoever runs out of something adds it and whoever shops has the full list.”</p>

                <h3>5. Set up your Auto Pilots <i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i></h3>
                <p>This is my go-to mom hack to keep on top of the never-ending laundry that comes with having kids. I work from home when I’m not traveling, but you don’t need to work from home to practice this. I put a load in the washer in the morning, switch it to the dryer before dinner, and fold clothes before bed. When I got my first bonus from Financial Finesse, I asked brilliant space maximizer Evelyn Cucchiara (The Toy Tamer) to redo my laundry and play rooms so they were easier to keep tidy (working mom priorities, right?!). Nearly three years later, I am happy to report that both rooms are still tidy.</p>
                <p>Decide on an easy-to-grab, go-to housewarming gift. Choose a universal child’s birthday party gift that you can order online or pick up at a store nearby (or even-number-hack stock up on!). Find an easy-to-make (but still delicious) potluck dish for school events and family gatherings. Pare down your baking repertoire and decide on one thing you’ll make for every bake sale. Have a go-to outfit for important meetings.

                    When you are faced with having to bring a gift or a dish or a bottle of wine, you won’t have to spend any extra time shopping around, thinking, or researching what you’ll buy.  </p>
            
                <p>To save time and be more present, I’ve turned off social media notifications on my phone and Lisa from Lisa Tanner Writing finally convinced me to have even more social media willpower.

                    Lisa sets specific times of the day where she can look at Facebook. Her time is a precious resource, and she found it was so easy to lose 30 minutes to an hour to scrolling. Keeping social media activity to the evenings helps her stay present during the day and be more productive.
                    
                    I’m trying to follow Lisa’s lead and do a better job of keeping my phone on the counter when I get back from work. And thanks to technology, I can even set “downtime” on my phone using the Screen Time setting so that I can’t even use it between 5:30 and 8. Even if I’m using Facebook for my work instead of just scrolling, it can still wait until 8:00 pm. Hungry Hungry Hippos, however, cannot.</p>

                <h3>6. Divide and Conquer <i class="fa-solid fa-drumstick-bite"></i></h3>
                <p>Small Tasks Get Things Done
                    Time-batching is hands-down the best concept I learned in 2018. I first came across the concept when I finally read The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss last year.

                    I now use time-batching for a lot of my tasks, like processing email. It takes way less time to reply to 10 emails in a block of time, rather than responding to them here and there when they individually hit my inbox. It also takes much less time to go through everything in my physical mailbox at home once every few days instead of every single evening.
                    
                    I discovered that time-batching works for a lot of to-dos, but some items still function better as lone tasks. For example, I run a load of laundry usually just once a day. However, I time-batch folding a few loads of laundry at once. Essentially, I’ve discovered that time-consuming and draining tasks work better spread out, and and menial and mundane tasks work well for time-batching.
                    
                    Take a look at what you have to accomplish each day and see if the spread-out or time-batch method will work for any of them.</p>
                <p>How do I personally “do it all” as a working mom? Simple. I don’t. WE do. Not always perfectly, but as a team.

                    If you are a working mom with a partner, this is less of a working mom hack and more of a gentle suggestion. The suggestion being making the care/feeding/cleaning part of your lives a 50/50 split. Moms often carry more of the load of the household but it doesn’t have to be that way.
                    
                    For a long time, I was almost solely responsible for dinners around our house. But we both worked and were both rushing home at the end of the day. I finally realized that this plan wasn’t sustainable and that Glen could not read my mind.
                    
                    As soon as I voiced the concern, we came up with a simple plan to each cover specific dinner nights during the week. Tuesday and Thursday are no longer my responsibility and a weight got lifted off my shoulders.
                    
                    Sometimes working mom life hacks are as simple as using your words.

                <h3>7. Let It Go <i class="fa-solid fa-couch"></i></h3>
                <p>Remember how we talked about “having it all” and figuring out what “having it all” means to you? Part of that is prioritizing what you can Elsa style let go.

                    I’m going to be honest with you. My house is passably clean at best. It’s not all together dirty, but it’s not neat. The sink is not always cleared out every night. There is a stack of preschool art on the counter. I’m not sure where the Windex is.
                    
                    But it’s fine. We’re fine. I’ve let it go. Someday my house might be immaculate, but that day is not today. As a working mom with insanely active children and my own active imagination, there is only so much I can, and want, to do.
                    
                    This is why “let it go” is one of the best working mom life hacks I can leave you with. This working mom life is not going to look perfect from all angles, but it’s your life. Focus on the angles that matter most to you.
                    
                    What can you let go a little to give yourself the time for rest and fun? Find it.

                <h3>8. Find Time for Yourself <i class="fa-solid fa-key"></i></h3>
                <p>Like Yolanda, Taylor from The Accomplished Family knows that you can’t make time appear out of thin air, but she and I absolutely agree that some things are worth carving out time for. Specifically, the Non-Negotiables.

                    The Non-Negotiable(s) are the one thing or things that you are going to do for you as a working mom that day/week barring any massive unforeseen circumstances. This doesn’t need to be something monumental, but it should be yours.
                    
                    Example. Your Non-Negotiable could taking a walk every day at lunch. If you’re in a desk job especially, stretching those legs and getting some fresh air may be exactly what the doctor ordered to clean your head and give your body a little exercise.
                    
                    Or your Non-Negotiable could be reading for 20 minutes in the morning while the kids are still asleep, giving yourself an hour in the evening once a week for a pottery lesson, or calling the babysitter once a month for a night out with your spouse.
                    
                    Whatever it is that you know would make your working mom life feel a bit more like YOUR life, put it on your calendar and keep the appointment with yourself.</p>

                <p>
                    As rough and tough as life can get at times, having the best support system around you can make all the difference. For as long as I can remember, my family and I have always been four peas in a pod. Sure, we had our classic spats here and there, but we’ve always had each other’s back through thick and thin. I’ve dragged my family into some of my hardest times—times where I felt alone with no friends, times where my physical and mental health were on a slippery decline, and times where I had no inkling of what I wanted to do in life. But through it all, I’ve had one constant in my life, one grip of hope where I felt myself slipping—my family. I’m lucky enough to say that regardless of any struggles thrown in my direction, my family is my go-to and best support system. Here are some of my reasons why family will always be the best support system.

                <p>Candace from The Mom at Law is one of my people. She has three little ones under the age of five, is a lawyer, a writer, and one of the funniest people I know.
                    As one of her work from home working mom tips, she recommends connecting with like-minded folks and I couldn’t agree more. Especially because she called them “folks.”
                    It’s important it is to have people in your life who understand the challenges you are facing and can offer support, ideas, and a good laugh. At the office, there are people I know I can turn to if I need to have a mini break down about daycare. For my writing, I have groups of social media friends who make me laugh, support my work, and are so hilariously relatable. On the home front, I have working mom friends I can text to say “Ummm… pizza sauce is a vegetable right? Please tell pizza sauce is a vegetable.”   
                    Your people don’t need to live next door, or even in the same state. But when you find the right folks you can relate to and share with, your working mom life is going to feel a lot more fun.
