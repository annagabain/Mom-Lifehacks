            <p>
                "The pressure of an increasingly demanding work culture is one of the biggest challenges to society... A healthy work-life balance will mean different things to us all. It’s not so much about splitting your time 50/50 between work and leisure but making sure you feel fulfilled and content in both areas of your life" (Mental Health Foundation, 2021).
            </p>

                <h3>1. Manage your Time <i class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> </h3>
                <p>
                    There are only limited amount of hours in each day. The time flies by and there is so much to do! 
                    Be the master of your schedule and asign a to-do list per daytime, weekdays and periodically. 
                    Make sure the list includes most of the must-haves and is always at hand. A digital calendar on your phone might be the way to go. 
                    Highlight the essentials and mark priorities. 
                    Absolutely important and urgent events get the colour red, then orange, yellow and green get the next marks down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can be beneficial to know your personal productivity timing. Ask yourself, for example, when am I the best at writing emails? 
                    Some moms find it easier to focus in the evenings, some in the mornings. 
                    So set up the to-do's accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The schedule does not need to be extremely precise, otherwise you are risking to cause yourself extra stress when things take 
                    a little bit longer time or something else comes along. 
                    Leave some margins for unexpected events.  
                    Most importantly, do not forget to take small breaks in-between to-do's. 
                    Not only they will mark the completed tasks, but will drastically improve your performance with the next ones.

                <h3>2. Take a Power Nap <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    "Employers are increasingly recognizing the benefits of a power nap as an effective means of stimulating both attention and performance and 
                    are taking this into consideration when planning office layouts and schedules" (sleepcycle.com, 2022).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is taking a nap listed right under the time management lifehack? 
                    Because you cannot focus within your decided timeframes if you are constantly tired! 
                    However, worth noting that power naps are not for everyone and do not always work. 
                    Sometimes, just short breaks as mentioned above are just enough and can perfectly do the trick.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    How long do you need to recharge your batteries? The general rule of thumb suggest 15-20 minutes should do. 
                    It is good to set a timer that will be the wake up call and cancel the worries about oversleeping and being late. 
                    The best time is suggested after lunch. But again, depending on circumstances you might like taking your power nap earlier or later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ambience is responsible for the quality of the sleep. It is better to have a quiet place with a bed to lie down offcorse. 
                    If not the case, choose a private, rather dark spot, let's say with a comfortable armchair where the power nap will go uninterupted.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Plan the Meals <i class="fa-solid fa-utensils"></i></h3>
                <p>
                    What do we have for dinner today? 
                    This is probably one of the most challenging day-to-day problems for all parents, working or stay-home. 
                    Depending on your budget and local services there are several options to consider and most of them include planning meals beforehand. 
                    Take-outs and pizza deliveries can always be somehting to consider, especially during busy and stressful weekdays. 
                    Nothing to feel guilty about as long as everyone is well nourished and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ingredient delivery services offer a variety of choice, from pre-cut and pre-portioned vegetables to combi-bags with spices and sauces. 
                    Many of them include recipes that take no more than 15-25 minutes of praparation time. 
                    Besides the convenience of a quick put-together, healthy meal, these services often take the tough decision of what to cook off your shoulders. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    If the pre-planned recipe delivery is not an option, you can opt for a regular supermarket grocery delivery service for a moderate fee. 
                    All you need to do is deciding on the fridge, freezer or shelf placement and place an order, often online. 
                    That way you can stock up on pantry items and focus on daily fresh supplies only. 
                    You then might need to only pass by the bakery on your way home for some fresh buns and the grocery isle for just that one letuce head. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many working mothers cook and prepare portions for the whole week during weekend. 
                    That way, the pressure is off during hectic mornings and tired evenings by just taking a home-made, microwave-ready meal out of the fridge or freezer.

                <p>
                    I could not formulate it better than this. So here is a small paragraph from Becca that says it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Non-Negotiable(s) are the one thing or things that you are going to do for you as a working mom that day/week barring any massive unforeseen circumstances. This doesn’t need to be something monumental, but it should be yours. Example. Your Non-Negotiable could taking a walk every day at lunch. If you’re in a desk job especially, stretching those legs and getting some fresh air may be exactly what the doctor ordered to clean your head and give your body a little exercise. Or your Non-Negotiable could be reading for 20 minutes in the morning while the kids are still asleep, giving yourself an hour in the evening once a week for a pottery lesson, or calling the babysitter once a month for a night out with your spouse. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Whatever it is that you know would make your working mom life feel a bit more like YOUR life, put it on your calendar and keep the appointment with yourself" (withlovebecca.com, viewed on 27.05.22).

                    Divide and conquer is a powerful tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases, and of combining sub-problems to the original problem.
